# MyWeatherForecast
Describing the weather for five days depending on the location.

## Description

This challenge allowed me to investigate the use of the APIs and the importance of the correct words in Javascript, it was really challenging but with tutoring and investigation it went well.

## Installation

For this Challenge I used mainly GitHub, VS Code and an internet browser. 

## User Story

The challenge indicates the desires to accomplish:
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
